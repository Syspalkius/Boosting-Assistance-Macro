## About
This is a bee swarm macro made using ahk v1.1
This macro is meant to make it easier to boost by assisting you with things such as: using materials, alt account pollination and alt account materials utilizing a command system in order to communicate to the alt account when you want it to use certain items.

## Main
This part of the macro is meant to be used on your main account while boosting, in this macro you are able to set timers for certain slots in your hotbar in order to use items at a specific rate and you are also able to set a hotkey which will be used for when you want to send a command to your alt account.

## Alt
This part of the macro is meant to be used for alt accounts. 
you can set a pattern in which your alt account will be walking in the field in order to ensure that it grabs tokens.
you can time certain spots in the hotbar such as gumdrops and jelly beans.
you can receive commands and then you can choose if you want to use gumdrops, jelly beans or clouds

## Commands
Commands are sent through the in-game chat, the macro types a certain phrase which is then detected by the alt account via imagesearch.
After the alt account is done doing everything it has to do for the command it will flood the chat to ensure that it does not detect the same command multiple times.
